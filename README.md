## Summary

This site was created for DBC Machine INC using the free template provided by Creative Tim. Please see below for resources on this template that uses Material Tailwind and React


**Fully Coded Elements**

Material Tailwind Kit React is built with over 40 frontend individual elements coming from @material-tailwind/react, like buttons, inputs, navbars, nav tabs, cards, or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, which you can easily modify using props and tailwind css classnames. You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code because all elements are implemented.

This free Material Tailwind, Tailwind CSS & React UI Kit is coming with prebuilt design blocks, so the development process is seamless, switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.
